Story: Backup orders

	As an Inventory Manager
	Before starting to edit an order I want to store a backup
	in order to restore the original order if necessary
	
	
Scenario: List of new and draft orders
	
	Given a manager for inventory pool 'ABC' logs in as 'inv_man_0'
	Given the list of submitted orders contains 3 elements

	When inventory_manager clicks 'acknowledge'	
	Then he sees 3 submitted orders and 0 draft orders 

	When he chooses one order
	Then a backup for the order is generated

	When inventory_manager clicks 'acknowledge'	
	Then he sees 2 submitted orders and 1 draft order 


Scenario: Restore an order

	Given a manager for inventory pool 'ABC' logs in as 'inv_man_0'
	Given a submitted order with 4 order lines
	And the order has 1 changes

	Then a backup for the order is generated
	
	When he deletes 3 order line
	Then the order has 1 order lines
	And the order has 4 changes
	
	When he restores the order
	Then the restored order has the same 4 order lines as the original
	And the restored order has the same 1 changes as the original
	
	Then is redirected to 'acknowledge'
	And he sees 1 submitted order and 0 draft orders
