Story: Availability depending on Pools

	As an Inventory Manager 
	I want to be sure that a user only gets to see models from inventory pools he has access to
	In order to prevent a user from ordering things he cannot borrow
	
	
	Scenario: Basic
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Coffee Mug' is available at all pools
	And this model has 2 items in inventory pool 1
	And this model has 3 items in inventory pool 2
	And user 'joe' has access to inventory pool 1
	And user 'jack' has access to inventory pool 1 and 2
	And user 'john' has access to inventory pool 2
	
	Then the maximum number of available 'Coffee Mugs' for 'joe' is 2
	And the maximum number of available 'Coffee Mugs' for 'jack' is 5
	And the maximum number of available 'Coffee Mugs' for 'john' is 3
	
	Scenario: Items available in different pools
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Coffee Mug' is available at all pools
	And this model has 2 items in inventory pool 1
	And this model has 3 items in inventory pool 2
	And model 'Coffee Machine' is available at pool 1
	And this model has 1 items in inventory pool 1
	And user 'jack' has access to inventory pool 1 and 2
	
	When 'jack' orders 2 'Coffee Mugs'
	And 'jack' order 1 'Coffee Machine'
	
	Then 1 Order exists for inventory pool 1
	And it asks for 3 items
	And 0 Orders exist for inventory pool 2
	
	Scenario: Splitting order and notifying user
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Coffee Mug' is available at pool 2
	And this model has 3 items in inventory pool 2
	And model 'Coffee Machine' is available at pool 1
	And this model has 1 items in inventory pool 1
	And user 'jack' has access to inventory pool 1 and 2
	
	When 'jack' orders 3 'Coffee Mugs'
	And 'jack' orders 1 'Coffee Machine'
	
	Then 1 Order exists for inventory pool 1
	And it asks for 1 item
	And 1 Order exists for inventory pool 2
	And it asks for 3 items
	And user 'jack' received an email with subject 'Your order has been split'
	And it contains information that he has to pick up 1 item at inventory pool 1
	And it contains information that he has to pick up 3 item at inventory pool 2
	
	Scenario : User can't order things that user can't see
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Coffee Mug' is available at pool 2
	And this model has 3 items in inventory pool 2
	And model 'Coffee Machine' is available at pool 1
	And this model has 1 items in inventory pool 1
	And user 'jack' has access to inventory pool 1
	
	When 'jack' searches for 'Coffee Mug'
	Then he gets an empty result set.
	
	When 'jack' searches for 'Coffee'
	Then he sees 'Coffee Machine'
	
	Scenario: User must have instructions
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Laser-guided HiSpeed Camera' is available at pool 2
	And this model has 1 item in inventory pool 2
	And this model requires users to have 'Using Baseball bats in camera maintenance' certification
	And user 'jack' has access to inventory pool 2
	
	When 'jack' orders 'Laser-guided HiSpeed Camera'
	
	Then he is notified that he needs a certification to get this item
	
	Given 'jack' has a certification in 'Using Baseball bats in camera maintenance'
	
	When 'jack' orders 'Laser-guided HiSpeed Camera'
	
	Then his order contains 1 item
	
	Scenario: Hide inventory from user groups
	
	Given 2 inventory pools
	And model 'Camera Canon Powershot S200' is available at pool 1
	And this model has 3 items in inventory pool 1
	And this model should not be seen by 'Video student'
	And 'jack' has access to inventory pool 1
	
	When 'jack' orders 'Camera Canon Powershot S200'
	
	Then his order contains 1 item
	
	Given 'jack' belongs to group 'Video student'
	
	When 'jack' orders 'Camera Canon Powershot S200'
	
	Then he is not allowed to do that.
