Story: Handout
	
	As an inventory manager 
	I want to hand out items
	So that I can fulfill orders
	
	Scenario: Handout simple order with barcode scanner
	
	Given a user named Hans Meier
	And he ordered 1 item starting from today
	And an object of that item with number 14 exists
	And the order was accepted
	
	When Hans Meier identifies himself by name
	And wants to get his items
	
	Then the inventory manager clicks on 'hand out'
	And Hans Meier appears in the list
	
	When the inventory manager selects Hans Meier from the list
	
	Then the reserved item appears in a list
	
	When the inventory manager picks up the object
	And the barcode scanner identifies the object as 14
	
	Then the reserved item in the list is marked as 14
	
	When the inventory manager clicks 'hand-out'
	
	Then he can create a pdf that contains the item with number 14
	
	When the inventory manager clicks 'done'
	
	Then he is on 'hand out overview'
	And the list is empty
	
	When the inventory manager clicks on 'return'
	
	Then Hans Meier appears on the list
	
	Scenario: Handout simple order with miscellaneous stuff
	
	Given a user named Hans Meier
	And he ordered 1 item starting from today
	And an object of that item with number 14 exists
	And the order was accepted
	And a miscellaneous item with name '3 m USB-Kabel' and number 5 exists
	
	When Hans Meier identifies himself by name
	And wants to get his items
	
	Then the inventory manager clicks on 'hand out'
	And Hans Meier appears in the list
	
	When the inventory manager selects Hans Meier from the list
	
	Then the reserved item appears in a list
	
	When the inventory manager picks up the object
	And the barcode scanner identifies the object as 14
