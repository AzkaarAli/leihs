Story: Handling of workdays

	As an Inventory Manager
	I want to be able to define which days I work
	in order to not having to worry about somebody wanting to pick up or bring back something on a day I plan to stay home.
	
Scenario: Default Workdays

	When I try to order an item for 4.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a saturday
	
	When I try to order an item for 5.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a sunday
	
	When I try to order an item for 6.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
	When I try to order an item for 7.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
	When I try to order an item for 8.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
	When I try to order an item for 9.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
	When I try to order an item for 10.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
Scenario: Only works Mondays and Wednesdays

	Given inventory_pool is open on Monday, Wednesday

	When I try to order an item for 4.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a saturday

	When I try to order an item for 5.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a sunday

	When I try to order an item for 6.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable (monday is open)

	When I try to order an item for 7.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a Tuesday

	When I try to order an item for 8.10.2008
	Then the order should be approvable (Wednesday is open)

	When I try to order an item for 9.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a Thursday

	When I try to order an item for 10.10.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable because it's a Friday

Scenario: With Holidays

	Given holidays are from 1.7.2008 - 31.7.2008 because of Summer Holiday
	And 1.1.2008 is free because of New Year
	
	When I try to order an item for 1.1.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable (because of New Year)
	
	When I try to order an item for 2.1.2008
	Then the order should be approvable
	
	When I try to order an item for 1.7.2008
	Then the order should not be approvable (because of Summer Holiday)
	
	When I try to order an item for 31.7.2008

Scenario: Hand Over on a Sunday

	Given today is Sunday 5.10.2008
	
	When an inventory manager clicks 'hand over'
	And he tries to hand over an item to a customer
	
	Then that should be possible
	
	When trying to set the end date to the same date
	Then that should not be possible because the end date can't be on a Sunday
	
Scenario: Hand Over during holiday

	Given 1.1.2008 is free because of New Year
	And today is Sunday 1.1.2008

	When an inventory manager clicks 'hand over'
	And he tries to hand over an item to a customer
	
	Then that should be possible
	
	When trying to set the end date to the same date
	Then that should not be possible because the end date can't be on a holiday
