Story: Backup orders

	As an inventory_manager
	I want to see all approved orders, grouped by user,
	in order to generate contracts and hand over the phisical items

	
Scenario: List approved orders, grouped by user
	
	Given the list of approved orders contains 0 elements
	
	When a new order with 3 order lines is placed by a user named 'Joe'
	And an inventory_manager approves the order
	And inventory_manager clicks 'hand_over'
	Then he sees 1 element with 3 lines

	When a new order with 2 order lines is placed by a user named 'Joe'
	And an inventory_manager approves the order
	And inventory_manager clicks 'hand_over'
	Then he sees 1 element with 5 lines

	
	
Scenario: List of approved order lines of a given user
	

Scenario: Select order lines to hand over
