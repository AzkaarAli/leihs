Story: Backup orders

	As an inventory_manager
	Before starting to edit an order I want to store a backup
	in order to restore the original order if necessary
	
	
Scenario: List of new and draft orders
	
	Given the list of new orders contains 3 elements

	When inventory_manager clicks 'acknowledge'	
	Then he sees 3 new orders and 0 draft orders 

	When he chooses one order
	Then a backup for the order is generated

	When inventory_manager clicks 'acknowledge'	
	Then he sees 2 new orders and 1 draft order
