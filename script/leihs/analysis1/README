This tool takes production.log's and makes a graph out of them
==============================================================

* how to do that

1. on the production server:
   $ (zcat production.log-*.gz; cat production.log) > /tmp/production.log-all

2. wherever you want to process the logs:
   cat /tmp/production.log-all | ./00_all.rb > means.csv

3. open means.csv in Excel or OpenOffice or Numbers or Gnumeric or whatever
   and produce a nice graph off that file
