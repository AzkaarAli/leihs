    leihs - a borrowing/lending/resource management system 
            written in Ruby on Rails  


It is quite shameful, but there is nothing in terms of
documentation for this project so far.

We realize this isn't the way to do things properly, but
we chose to give higher priority to the release of the 
project itself in a fashion that enables its development
as Free Software later on.

Since it's a "plain" Ruby on Rails application, we're
reasonably sure that you can set it up without our help
by going through the database dumps etc.

More information forthcoming! ;)
