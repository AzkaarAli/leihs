    leihs - a borrowing/lending/resource management system 
            written in Ruby on Rails  

+ General

This is the development branch for version 2.0 of leihs.

2.0 is an ambitious rewrite of 1.x, evading the errors we
made the first time round and making everyone really really
happy.

We can hope, can't we?

+ Dependencies

leihs depends on the following gems and/or modules:

Barby 
gettext
ferret

They are included in the vendor directory, but if you see any reason to use
your own system-wide versions, please do.
