== Introduction ==

leihs is web-based inventory handling and resource booking system. It allows
users to view available equipment and place reservations through the frontend.
Inventory managers and sysadmins use the backend to handle incoming
reservations and manage items in the inventory.

This guide shows you how to use leihs. You don't need to install anything on
your own machine to use leihs, all you need is a web browser.


== Definitions ==

Below references to defined terms are capitalized and in quotes, as f.ex.
"Manager".

Access Rights::
    see "User"

Contract::
    is produced as soon as an "Order" is acknowledged by a "Manager"

Customer::
    a "User" that has the right to borrow "Items". See also "User"

Inventory Pool::
    TODO

Item::
    a thing that can be borrowed. An Items is of a certrain "Model". An
    "Inventory Pool" can have several "Lenovo T40" laptops. Thus
    "Lenovo T40" would be the "Model" of which the "Inventory Pool" could
    have three "Items" labeled "T40-1", "T40-2", and "T40-3"

Manager::
    a "User" that has the right to lend "Items".

Model::
    see "Item"

Order::
    TODO

User::
    can be a Customer and/or Manager or a Administrator. These "Access Rights"
    are given per "Inventory Pool" or in the case of the Administrator for the
    whole of leihs.


== Availability ==

A central element of leihs is management of availavilities of models i.e.
the question:

_Is some model available to be lent out from a certain day on to some end date?
Or are all available items of that model allready reserved for other
customers?_

When lending out items, the inventory pool manager needs to be aware of the
fact, that if he assigns an item to a contract that is in the future, then that
item becomes immediately unavailable.

This is based on the assumption, that if an item that is reserved in the future
would be lent out before that date, then there would be a risk, that the
anterior borrower would not return the item, which would break the promise
previously given to the posterior borrower that he effectively will get the
reserved item. This means that leihs gives precedence to fullfilling promises
over optimal allocation utilization.


== Management of the Borrowing Workflow ==

When handing over items to the customer, leihs will by default produce a PDF
contract and display it to the inventory pool manager that is executing the
transaction, at which moment the manager can print out the PDF contract.

He can now give the contract to the customer for signature or proceed with
other offline (that is not part of leihs itself) steps in the borrowing
process.

If the inventory pool manager does not wish to see contracts when he hands over
items, then he can configure that.  There is a checkbox "Print contracts" in
Backend->Administration->Inventory Pool->bottom of the page. 

== Groups ==

If you immediately want to try out the "Groups" feature, then go to the
backend of one of your inventory pools, then either to "Own models" or
"Models" (anywhere you have models, really). Now edit some model. In the
leftmost tab shows you the "Availability" of that model where you can
choose to "Change group quantities".

Let's explain the feature using an example. Let's we have the following
situation:

* there are 40 cameras of type Canon XYZ
* 20 should be borrowable by everybody (through the "General Group",
  which is being managed automatically by the system)
* 10 should be available to users in "Photography students" "Group" only
* and 10 should be in the "Group" "Web and videocasting students"

Let's say you have 150 photography students and 3000 students in
total. This makes sure that the photography students have a
disproportianate number of cameras available to them, so they're more
likely to get one when they do need to book a camera.

Or you can use it to manage certification situations. One could make
certain expensive cameras are only borrowable by people who took a
course on how to correctly handle that camera. So we could create a
"Group" "Certified for Big Camera" and add _all_ those cameras to
that group. And then add users one by one, as they show up with a
proof that they took the course.
