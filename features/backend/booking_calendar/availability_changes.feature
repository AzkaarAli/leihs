Feature: Availability Changes in Booking Calendar

  In order to see when a model is available and unavailable
  As a Lending Manager
  I want to see the availability changes in a calendar

  Background:
    Given personas existing
      And I am "Pius"

  Scenario: Seeing all availability changes in the booking calendar
    #When I open a booking calendar to edit a singe line
    #Then I see all availability changes and availability in between the changes in that calendar
